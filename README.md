# UFOs Analysis

## Overview
In hopes of one day working for NASA, we helped Dana create a dynamic webpage, complete with backgrounds, pictures, and plenty of information, that filters UFO sightings in a table. The table accepts input of date, city, state, country, and shape. 

### Resources
- Data Source: data.js
- Software: JavaScript, HTML, CSS

## Results
Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

After reading the Dr. Ursula F. Olivier's comments you are ready to Dana's webpage to help you find your answer to the question, "Are we alone in the universe?" You scroll down on the webpage to reveal a long table that is full of information about UFO sightings. This seems like too much information to take in all at once, that's when you notice on the left-hand side of the screen there is a "Filter Search." The first filter option is date. You're curious to see if there were any UFO sighting on your birthday. The placeholder in the "Enter Date" box directs you to use the structure 1/10/2020 so go ahead and plug in your birthday to see if you had any foreign visitors paid a visit to eartch on your bithday.

If you were born on January 12th there are eight results! It looks like outerspace visitors were throwing you a party in the sky! You can narrow this search down further to see if there visited your very own city. Type 

A similar search come be done by entering a city, state, country, and shape into the respected filter searches. 

## Summary
Together we were able to create a neat and useful webpage but there are some things that could be included to improve it. A drawback of this webpage is the large amount of data in the table causes the webpage to extend a long way down. My recommendation for further development would be to create a scroll feature in the table. This will allow the whole webpage to more compact and easier to read. Another suggestion I would make it to include a brief set of directions of how to use the filter feature. It may seem intuitative to use but I think reinserting the button would allow users to clearly see how the filtering function works.
