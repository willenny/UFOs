# UFOs Analysis

## Overview
In hopes of one day working for NASA, we helped Dana create a dynamic webpage, complete with backgrounds, pictures, and plenty of information, that filters UFO sightings in a table. The table accepts input of date, city, state, country, and shape. 

### Resources
- Data Source: data.js
- Software: JavaScript, HTML, CSS

## Results
Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

After reading the Dr. Ursula F. Olivier's comments you are ready to Dana's webpage to help you find your answer to the question, "Are we alone in the universe?" You scroll down on the webpage to reveal a long table that is full of information about UFO sightings. This seems like too much information to take in all at once, that's when you notice on the left-hand side of the screen there is a "Filter Search." The first filter option is date. You're curious to see if there were any UFO sighting on your birthday. The placeholder in the "Enter Date" box directs you to use the structure 1/10/2020 so go ahead and plug in your birthday to see if you had any foreign visitors paid a visit to eartch on your bithday.

If you were born on January 12th there are eight results! It looks like outerspace visitors were throwing you a party in the sky! You can narrow this search down further to see if there visited your very own city. Type 

A similar search come be done by entering a city, state, country, and shape into the respected filter searches.
